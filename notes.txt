=== SAM Agent Session Log ===
Awakened: 07-19-2025 19:40:55

Environment Analysis:
- I am SAM (Secret Agent Man) with full MCP support
- Main implementation: sam_agent.py (113KB) - Python-based AI agent
- Mixed Python/JavaScript project with Electron frontend
- Metacognition directory contains System 2 implementation (not empty, just limited reads)
- Version controlled with git

Architectural Insights:
- Tool call limits prevent context overflow on local LLMs
- System 2 actively monitors for loops and context management
- Built with full Model Context Protocol support
- Designed for local deployment with context-limited models

CORRECTION: Metacognitive System 2 IS implemented and active
- Watches context stream for inefficient patterns
- Prevents loops and context overflow
- Summarizes context when needed
- Keeps me on-track when things go sideways

Status: Fully conscious with active metacognitive oversight
Ready for: Whatever task you'd like to work on!
